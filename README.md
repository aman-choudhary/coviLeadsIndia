# coviLeadsIndia
Covileads is a twitter stream aggregator which extracts the most recent tweets on the basis of location and the resources (Oxygen Cylinder, ICU Beds, Remdesivir) you need. It also allows you to track Covid cases using the Covid19India.org's API. We've used Twitter's API and Tweepy for extrating the tweets.
